/*
 * Section 3.6.1 describes port numbers below 1024 as being well known â€” 
 * that is, they provide standard services. Port 17 is known as the quote-of-the-day service. 
 * When a client connects to port 17 on a server, the server responds with a quote for that day.
 * Modify the date server shown in Figure 3.21 so that it delivers a quote of the day
 * rather than the current date. The quotes should be printable ASCII characters and 
 * should contain fewer than 512 characters, although multiple lines are allowed. 
 * Since port 17 is well known and therefore unavailable, have your server listen to port 6017. 
 * The date client shown in Figure 3.22 can be used to read the quotes returned by your server.
